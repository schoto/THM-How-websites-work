<h4>Introduction</h4>

This room breaks each OWASP topic down and includes details on the vulnerabilities, how they occur, and how you can exploit them. You will put the theory into practice by completing supporting challenges.

1.Broken Access Control

2.Cryptographic Failures

3.Injection

4.Insecure Design

5.Security Misconfiguration

6.Vulnerable and Outdated Components

7.Identification and Authentication Failures

8.Software and Data Integrity Failures

9.Security Logging & Monitoring Failures

10.Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

The room has been designed for beginners and assumes no previous security knowledge.

<h4>Broken Access Control</h4>

Websites have pages that are protected from regular visitors. For example, only the site's admin user should be able to access a page to manage other users. If a website visitor can access protected pages they are not meant to see, then the access controls are broken.

A regular visitor being able to access protected pages can lead to the following:

- Being able to view sensitive information from other users

- Accessing unauthorized functionality

Simply put, broken access control allows attackers to bypass authorisation, allowing them to view sensitive data or perform tasks they aren't supposed to.
