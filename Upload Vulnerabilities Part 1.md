<h3>Getting started</h3>

Please read and follow the instructions in this task carefully. If you skip over this task and encounter connectivity errors as a result, the Discord volunteers reserve the right to ignore you.

The instructions in this task will help you to configure the hosts file of your device. The hosts file is used for local domain name mapping, bypassing DNS. In short, it allows you to map IP addresses to domain names locally without relying on a DNS server to resolve the IP address for you. This is useful in environments such as TryHackMe where DNS is not available as it allows us to manually map one or more domains / subdomains to an IP address of our choosing. Being able to access content using a domain makes it possible to (amongst many other advantages) use name-based virtual hosting -- commonly shortened to "vhosting" -- to serve multiple websites from a single webserver: a feature which is used extensively in this room.

It is very important that you understand these concepts before continuing. If any of the above information does not make sense, please do some background reading (e.g., here) into how domain names, IP addresses, and webserver VHosts work before continuing with the content of this room.

First up, let's deploy the machine to give it a few minutes to boot.

Once you've clicked deploy, you'll need to configure your own computer to be able to connect.

If you've successfully deployed the machine then the following code blocks will already have the IP address filled in. If any of them have "MACHâ€‹INE_IP" in them, then you still need to deploy the machine, and the following instructions will not work.
