When you visit a website, your browser (like Safari or Google Chrome) makes a request to a web server asking for information about the page you're visiting. 
It will respond with data that your browser uses to show you the page; a web server is just a dedicated computer somewhere else in the world that handles your requests.

There are two major components that make up a website:

Front End (Client-Side) - the way your browser renders a website.
Back End (Server-Side) - a server that processes your request and returns a response.
There are many other processes involved in your browser making a request to a web server, but for now, you just need to understand that you make a request to a server, and it responds with data your browser uses to render information to you.

What term best describes the component of a web application rendered by your browser?
