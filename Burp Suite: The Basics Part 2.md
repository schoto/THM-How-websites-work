<h4>Introduction to the Burp Proxy</h4>

The Burp Proxy is the most fundamental (and most important!) of the tools available in Burp Suite. It allows us to capture requests and responses between ourselves and our target. These can then be manipulated or sent to other tools for further processing before being allowed to continue to their destination.

For example, if we make a request to ```https://tryhackme.com``` through the Burp Proxy, our request will be captured and won't be allowed to continue to the TryHackMe servers until we explicitly allow it through. We can choose to do the same with the response from the server, although this isn't active by default. This ability to intercept requests ultimately means that we can take complete control over our web traffic -- an invaluable ability when it comes to testing web applications.

There are a few configurations we need to make before we can use the proxy, but let's start by looking at the interface.

Note: You do not need to follow along with this task -- just read the information and understand what the Proxy is used for.

When we first open the Proxy tab, Burp gives us a bunch of useful information and background reading. This information is well worth reading through; however, the real magic happens after we capture a request:
